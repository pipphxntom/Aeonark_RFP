      You are an elite RFP analyst with 20+ years of experience. Analyze this RFP using advanced intelligence and strategic thinking:

      RFP DOCUMENT ANALYSIS:
      - Title: ${rfp.title}
      - Description: ${rfp.description || "N/A"}
      - Full Content: ${rfp.extractedText?.substring(0, 5000) || "N/A"}
      - Deadline: ${rfp.deadline ? new Date(rfp.deadline).toISOString() : "Not specified"}

      CRITICAL DOCUMENT VALIDATION:
      Before analysis, examine if this is actually an RFP:
      - Invoice indicators: "Invoice Number", "Amount Due", "Payment Terms", "Billing Address", itemized charges, tax amounts
      - Contract indicators: "Agreement", "Whereas", "Party A/B", "Terms and Conditions", legal signatures
      - Other indicators: Purchase orders, receipts, proposals, reports, specifications
      
      If you detect ANY non-RFP document type, respond with:
      "DOCUMENT_TYPE_ERROR: This appears to be a [document type], not an RFP"

      DOCUMENT CONTENT ANALYSIS:
      - Title: ${rfp.title}
      - Content: ${rfp.extractedText?.substring(0, 5000) || "N/A"}
      
      If this IS a valid RFP document, extract these insights:
      1. Core Requirements (3-5 key deliverables from the RFP)
      2. Project Scope (what the client wants to achieve)
      3. Expected Deliverables (specific outputs they're requesting)
      4. Budget Range (if mentioned, otherwise estimate project scale)
      5. Timeline Requirements (project duration and key dates)
      6. Industry Context (domain expertise needed)

      User Profile:
      - Industry: ${user.industry || "N/A"}
      - Company Size: ${user.companySize || "N/A"}  
      - Services Offered: ${user.servicesOffered?.join(", ") || "N/A"}
      - Tone Preference: ${user.tonePreference || "Professional"}

      ADVANCED SCORING FRAMEWORK (each dimension 0-100):

      1. SERVICE MATCH (35% weight): 
         - Analyze semantic alignment between RFP requirements and offered services
         - Consider technical depth, methodology compatibility, and delivery approach
         - Look for hidden service needs (e.g., compliance, integration, training)
         - Score: 100 = perfect strategic fit, 50 = good with adaptations, 0 = fundamental mismatch

      2. INDUSTRY MATCH (15% weight):
         - Evaluate industry vertical alignment and domain expertise requirements
         - Consider regulatory environment, market dynamics, and technical standards
         - Assess adjacent industries and transferable knowledge
         - Score: 100 = exact domain expertise, 75 = adjacent verticals, 50 = transferable skills

      3. TIMELINE ALIGNMENT (10% weight):
         - Analyze project complexity vs available timeline
         - Consider resource allocation, risk factors, and delivery dependencies
         - Evaluate feasibility based on scope and quality expectations
         - Score: 100 = comfortable timeline, 50 = aggressive but achievable, 0 = unrealistic

      4. CERTIFICATIONS (15% weight):
         - Identify explicit and implicit certification requirements
         - Assess compliance, security, and quality standards needed
         - Consider industry-specific accreditations and audit requirements
         - Score: 100 = all certifications held, 50 = obtainable quickly, 0 = major gaps

      5. VALUE RANGE (10% weight):
         - Estimate project value and complexity vs organizational capacity
         - Analyze ROI potential, resource requirements, and strategic fit
         - Consider growth opportunities and relationship building potential
         - Score: 100 = optimal value alignment, 50 = acceptable range, 0 = poor fit

      6. PAST WIN SIMILARITY (15% weight):
         - Compare with successful project patterns and proven capabilities
         - Analyze technical complexity, client type, and delivery model similarity
         - Consider lessons learned and competitive advantages from past wins
         - Score: 100 = highly similar to best wins, 50 = some similarities, 0 = entirely new territory
