You are building the SmartMatch engine for a SaaS product named AeonRFP ‚Äî a proposal and contract automation tool for enterprises and consultants. This SmartMatch module will intelligently analyze an uploaded RFP, query, or contract, and match it to the most relevant clause templates, answers, or documents in a database.

Here‚Äôs what you need to build (split into backend logic + supporting frontend API endpoint):

üí° Functionality Overview
Users can upload RFPs or paste questions

The engine analyzes the input and matches it to the best-fit clauses/templates from a Supabase DB

The user can select which LLM model to use: OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, or Claude

Matching happens via vector embeddings and a scoring mechanism

Ranks the top 5 matches and explains why it picked them

üì¶ Tech Stack and Structure
Backend:

Node.js + Express (or Next.js API route if easier)

Vector embeddings via OpenAI/Gemini/DeepSeek (use OpenAI as default fallback)

Supabase for clause storage and retrieval

EmailerSend or Mailersend integration for OTP (optional)

Use dotenv for environment variable config (e.g., API keys, Supabase URL)

Frontend:

A dropdown for LLM selection

File upload or text input box

Submit button ‚Üí calls backend

Result: Show top 5 clause matches with score and preview

üß† SmartMatch Backend: How it should work
Input Handling:

Accept text input or uploaded document (use PDF parsing via pdf-parse or pdfjs)

Sanitize and chunk the content if needed

Model Choice Logic:

Based on frontend dropdown, load API key and logic for:

OpenAI GPT-4

Claude

DeepSeek

Gemini

Abstract these into a modelRunner.js or llmDispatcher.ts that routes prompt accordingly

Embedding & Vector Matching:

Get embedding of the user query/input (OpenAI or Gemini embedding API)

Fetch existing clause embeddings from Supabase

Compute cosine similarity (or use pgvector extension if Supabase supports)

Rank top 5 closest matches

Response Construction:

Return JSON object: clause title, content, similarity score

Add explanation using chosen LLM:

‚ÄúWhy was this clause selected?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow does this clause address the requirement?‚Äù
