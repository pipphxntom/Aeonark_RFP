📈 1. Analytics Dashboard – Your Command Center
After the user has submitted 1 or more proposals, the system surfaces a dedicated analytics dashboard that feels like a mission control interface.

🖥️ Dashboard UI Design:
Section	Visual Element	Data Tracked
🧭 Overview Cards	Neon-glow stat blocks (4-column grid)	Proposals Sent, Win Rate %, Avg Score, Time Saved
📈 Line Graph	Real-time glowing trend chart	Draft Turnaround Time by Week
📊 Pie/Donut Graph	Radial animation spin on load	RFPs by Industry / Outcome
🔁 Win Funnel	Smooth step flow: Upload → Draft → Sent → Won	Lead conversion visualization
💬 Top Clause Usage	Clause cloud + frequency meter	Smart reuse heatmap

🧠 Animation Effects:
When graphs load, data lines draw in real-time with pulse on peaks

Hovering shows data tooltip with animated micro-bars per metric

On scroll-in, charts animate like entering an energy field

📥 2. Automation: Gmail & Slack RFP Capture System
This is where AeonRFP becomes passive, reactive, intelligent.

🔐 Gmail Integration Flow:
User clicks “Connect Gmail”

OAuth pop-up → grant access

App filters emails with:

Subject line: contains RFP, Tender, Proposal, EOI

Attachments: .pdf, .docx

🤖 Once connected:
Every 30 min, the system scans inbox

New files = auto-upload + run SmartMatch

Notification appears:

“📩 New RFP from WorldBank detected — 91% match. Draft ready to review.”

💬 Slack Integration:
User connects channel #rfps

Bot listens for file drops or keywords

Auto-replies:

“Hey team, I’ve scanned the new RFP — looks like a solid match. Click to generate proposal.”

📦 3. Proposal Status Tracking System
On the Drafts page, each proposal card shows a status badge:
