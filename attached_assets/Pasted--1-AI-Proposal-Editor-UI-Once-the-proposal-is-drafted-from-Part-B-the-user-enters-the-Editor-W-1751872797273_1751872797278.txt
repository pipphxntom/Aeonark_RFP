✍️ 1. AI Proposal Editor UI
Once the proposal is drafted (from Part B), the user enters the Editor Workspace.

🎨 Layout Overview:
Section	Description
Left Sidebar	Navigation between proposal sections
Center Panel	Rich text editor – AI-drafted content loaded per block
Right Sidebar	Company memory suggestions, clause drag-and-drop panel
Top Bar	Breadcrumbs + Save/Export/Share buttons

✨ Animations & Transitions:
Each section loads with slide-up + glow-in transition.

Section titles have glowing underlines on scroll.

Typing or editing text creates subtle neon ripples behind the cursor (light but futuristic).

💡 Proposal Blocks Example:
css
Copy
Edit
[ Executive Summary ]        ✅ Done
[ Scope of Work ]            ✏️ Editing
[ Deliverables ]             ⏳ Pending Review
[ Pricing Table ]            ✅ Saved
[ Legal Terms ]              ❌ Needs Action
Hovering over a block:

Option panel appears:

🔁 Regenerate | ✏️ Edit | 💾 Save | ❌ Clear

When you regenerate:

Animated wave washes over the section (like a "rewrite in progress" effect)

🧠 2. Memory Engine: Clause Reuse & AI Retrieval
Right Sidebar — “Company Memory Engine”
Live Suggestions Panel:

Title: Suggested Reuse from Past Wins

Each clause block slides in from right:

💬 “Used in Deloitte Proposal (Won)”

💬 “Matches 87% with current SOW language”

You can:

🔄 Inject into current draft (animation: flash + appear in editor)

✏️ Edit and re-save into memory

📌 Pin for current project

🧱 Memory Engine Behind the Scenes:
Pulls data from:

Past submitted proposals

Uploaded pitch decks

Stored bios/clauses in company profile

Stored in Vector DB (Chroma or FAISS) with tags:

type: 'legal_clause', project: 'FintechRFP2023', tone: 'formal'

When the AI drafts a section, these are auto-injected as RAG context → better drafts, familiar voice.

📄 3. Export System – Template Fill + Branded Output
Once the proposal is finalized:

User Clicks: Export Proposal
Triggers glowing modal with options:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
Choose Export Format:
[📄 DOCX (Branded Template)]  
[📄 PDF (Formatted Layout)]  
[👁 Preview First]
Animation:

Each format tile pulses gently on hover

Click causes the selected tile to zoom out briefly as if being pulled into a generator

💼 Branded Template Logic:
If the user uploaded their .docx template earlier, AeonRFP:

Maps fields like {{client_name}}, {{project_scope}}, {{pricing}}

Fills them with AI-generated content

Backend uses:

docxtpl to fill Word template

WeasyPrint or Puppeteer to render PDF

🧪 Preview Mode (Live Flipbook UI):
3D flipbook animation appears

User can flip through rendered pages

Glowing "Download PDF" button below

Option: “Send to Client Email Now” (uses SendGrid or Mailgun)

🤝 4. Real-Time Collaboration (Team Draft Mode)
Feature Activation: Available on Growth Plan+
Invite collaborators:

Add emails → assign sections

Editor role: can write/edit

Viewer role: can comment only

UX Flow:

Comments appear inline like Google Docs

Hovering shows “typing” indicator for active collaborators

Autosaves every 10 seconds

“Last edited by [name] · 3 mins ago” appears top-right

🔐 5. Security & File Protection (During Draft & Export)
Feature	Behavior
File Encryption	Stored RFPs & drafts encrypted with AES-256
Auto File Deletion	Temp drafts deleted after X days unless pinned
Access Control	Role-based team access: Owner, Editor, Viewer
Export Logs	Tracks export time, file size, format, user who triggered

🌈 6. UI Theme & Visual Consistency
Colors:

Background: Deep navy → black

Accents: Neon cyan, green, violet

Text: Bright white + light grey body

Hover effects: subtle glows, magnetic pulls, and button push-in shadows

Fonts:

🧠 What the User Feels at This Stage:
"I didn’t just write a proposal… my company cloned its brain into this document — 10x faster, and 2x better."
