# OAuth Integration Status Check

## Current Status
Your AeonRFP application is running successfully on:
```
https://60e9e6fe-47eb-4c15-8bf9-5e2cce3314a9-00-1g5hlcuoey663.picard.replit.dev
```

## What Should Be Working Now

### If You Updated Google Cloud Console:
1. **Gmail Integration**: Should work if you added the exact redirect URI
2. **Error Resolution**: The "invalid_request" error should be resolved
3. **Connection Status**: OAuth status should show connection capability

### If You Haven't Updated Yet:
1. **App Functionality**: All core features work (OTP auth, proposals, analytics)
2. **OAuth Status**: Will show "Not Configured" but won't break anything
3. **Ready for OAuth**: Can add Google credentials whenever you're ready

## Testing Your OAuth Fix

### Quick Test Steps:
1. Log into your AeonRFP app
2. Go to Integrations page
3. Click "Connect Gmail"
4. Should redirect to Google OAuth (not show error 400)
5. Complete Google authentication
6. Should redirect back successfully

### If Still Getting Error 400:
- Double-check the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console matches exactly
- Ensure no extra spaces or characters
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Wait a few more minutes for Google's systems to propagate

## Current Redirect URI (Copy This Exactly):
```
https://60e9e6fe-47eb-4c15-8bf9-5e2cce3314a9-00-1g5hlcuoey663.picard.replit.dev/api/auth/google/callback
```
